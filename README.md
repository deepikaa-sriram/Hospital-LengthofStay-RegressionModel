# Hospital Length of Stay Regression Model

This was a project I completed as part of the Applied Data Science Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Using raw data from a hypothetical hospital, I conducted univariate and multivariate analyses of the dataset and used machine learning techniques, such as linear and non-linear regression modeling, to determine an optimal predictive model to determine length of stay for a patient. 

Based on the model's performance on the test dataset, the model I have generated can predict length of stay within an error of 1 day for a particular patient.
