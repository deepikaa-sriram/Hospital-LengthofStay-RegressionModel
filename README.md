# Hospital Length of Stay Regression Model

This was a project I completed as part of the Applied Data Science Program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Using raw data from a hypothetical hospital, I conducted univariate and multivariate analyses of the dataset and used machine learning methodologies to determine the most optimal predictive model to calculate the length of stay for a patient. 

Based on the model's performance on the test dataset, the model I have generated can predict length of stay within an error of 1 day for an admitted patient at this hospital. Using this model, the hospital will be able to more effectively identify important business insights to better guide their healthcare infrastructure, policies, resource allocation, and revenue.
